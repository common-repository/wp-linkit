== Description ==
<!--description-->
LinkIt will take your WordPress Links and match and insert them into your posts and pages.

To enable a link to be inserted to any post or page simply categorize it as `LinkIt` in the WordPress Links section.

If you do not wish the link to be visible in your BlogRoll simply mark it as a private link, the BlogRoll will ignore it but LinkIt will still allow it to be inserted.

LinkIt has been written to be safe and to get the best possible matches.

To prevent Links being inserted in the wrong place, being placed in tag attributes for example only the text parts of the parts will be replaced.

To prevent shorter links preventing longer links from matching, priority has been given to longer links.

As this plugin will add time to the displaying of the posts , we recommend the use of a post caching plugin. This is very important if your posts and very long or are tag heavy
